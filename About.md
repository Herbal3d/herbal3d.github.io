Herbal3d started as a personal experimental project to build a virtual world
viewer using WebGL. That was so long ago that I had to write my own WebSocket
drivers.

This grew into thinking about what a next generation viewer might look like.
Out of this grew the Basil project along with its family of modules.
The goal is to create a scalable, plugable, extensable viewer that is not
monolithic. I hope to add security and extensibility using the latest
Internet technologies.

Started in 2015 by [Robert Adams], the Herbal3d project will hopefully grow
into a large open source project.
